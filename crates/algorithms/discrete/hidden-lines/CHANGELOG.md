## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ScalarHiddenLines`, the exact scalar provider for `MeshHiddenLines`
  (ADR 0090, #138): boundary, silhouette and crease edges of triangle
  meshes split into visible and hidden pieces by exact interval and dyadic
  decisions, with endpoints that are the exact points rounded once. A near
  clipping plane that cuts a `Solid` mesh is refused as `UnsupportedInput`
  naming it.
