# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Pre-1.0: the minor version is the breaking-change slot, per Cargo's own
caret rule for `0.x` versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `exact_properties` honours face, shell-use and bound orientation. It
  read loop winding alone, which is only right for faces used forward; a
  `Reversed` cap off the plane `z = 0` added its volume instead of
  subtracting it (a unit cube at `2 <= z <= 3` measured 7/3). Every
  solid tested before sat on `z = 0`, where the error vanishes.
